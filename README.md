# Drone_MIDIShield

A simple script, for Aruino + [SparkFun MIDI Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12898), to play a single note continuously. 

If all you need is to play a drone, this can save you from having to hold down the key with your finger (or a heavy object) on a MIDI keyboard for the whole duration of your performance; or even from having to use a MIDI keyboard in the first place. 

A pocket sized one note player that comes to the rescue of the audacious!  

## Controls

* A0 knob: selects the note of the drone in the chromatic scale from C to B in the current octave;
* A1 knob: sends mod wheel CC message;
* D1 button: toggles the MIDI note on/off;
* D2 button: shifts the range of notes covered by A0 up an octave;
* D3 button: shifts the range of notes covered by A0 down an octave.
